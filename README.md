This playbook allows to apply an update of RHEL patch via yum
==============================================================

- By default, it updates all the patches and restart the server

- 6 types of update are available

      - All patches with restart      
      - All patches without restart      
      - Security patch only with restart      
      - Security patch only without restart      
      - Custom patch only with restart      
      - Custom patch only without restart      

- The following variables must be overwritten only if the default does not suit your need (eg by a group_vars patch_update)

      - security_only_required: "no" # yes/no   
      - reboot_required: "true"      # true/false   
      - package_name: '*'            # yum package name   
      - package_state: "latest"      # absent, installed, latest, present, removed
    
- You need ansible 2.7 to use the reboot module
